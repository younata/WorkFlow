## WorkFlow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/younata/WorkFlow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/younata/WorkFlow)

WorkFlow allows you to construct pipelines of work to do.

WorkFlow provides you with a more concrete State Machine for generic states (Currently, it only provides a linear state machine, with each state having the option to go back to the first, but none having the option to go to the end).
